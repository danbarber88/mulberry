          When you choose a local kitchen company you are going to receive a
          service that just cannot be matched by the larger retailers. Our
          designers, Geoff and Colleen have a combined experience of over 35
          years between them, completing hundreds of projects, large and small,
          throughout our local area.

          Therefore when you ask us to design your kitchen, we will be utilising
          our accrued knowledge and experience to make sure we exceed your
          expectations.
